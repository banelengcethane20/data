# that is generally correct if you have a teaching method the students will pass
#else students will fail

#also generally correct if you actually observe your students to check if work is done also observe that all the students work
#else they might fail because you will be assuming that they are studying while not that we be seen on tests
#but if you just observe and do nothing they might possible fail the exam

#But doing both Observing and having teaching method that work exceptionally well and on academic there will be a progress
#else they will fail.
